## Problema


28 - Considera o método com assinatura `void DoStuff()`. Assumindo que estás noutro método da mesma classe, escreve código para:


1. Declarar 100 _threads_ que executem o método `DoStuff()`.

2. Iniciar as 100 _threads_ de modo a que executem em paralelo.

3. Esperar que a execução dessas mesmas _threads_ termine.


## Solução



```cs

	// Variable that defines number of threads
        
	int numThreads = 100;
        
	// List to store all of the threads we are going to initialize
        
	List<Thread> threads = new List<Thread>();

        // For block that will handle the initialization of each Thread, start

        // them and also put them on the thread list.

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++)

        {

            // Initialization of the Thread.

            Thread test = new Thread(DoStuff);

            // Start of the Thread.

            test.Start();

            // Adding the thread to the list.

            threads.Add(test);

        }


        // Searches through every entry in the list to block the

        // current thread until the specified Thread has been finished.

        // Enabling all of the Threads to finish before the current Thread

        // continues.
        foreach (Thread thread in threads)

        {

            thread.Join();

        }

        // Notification that the threads have been finished successfully.

        Console.WriteLine("Threads are finished.");
